## 🔧 FAQ

### Basic
- **Q: What does this tool do?**
  It allows you to input multiple prompts at once, automatically generating images one by one and downloading them locally, without manual intervention.
- **Q: How to input prompts?**
  One prompt per line.
- **Q: Filename format?**
  Sequential naming: `page1.png`, `page2.png`... Saved in your browser's default download folder.

### Troubleshooting
- **Q: Extension can't find the input field?**
  1. Ensure you are on `https://gemini.google.com/app`.
  2. **Refresh the page** (issues often occur if the input box hasn't loaded yet).
  3. Check if your network node redirects the URL.
- **Q: My interface is in Traditional Chinese?**
  Please upgrade to **v1.1.1** or higher (fixed compatibility). If issues persist, try temporarily switching your system/account language to English or Simplified Chinese.
- **Q: Files are downloaded as .html?**
  This is because the browser blocked automatic downloads. Click the "Lock" icon in the address bar -> Site Settings -> **Allow Automatic downloads**.
- **Q: Sidebar blocking the view?**
  Click the extension icon to toggle the sidebar. This won't interrupt the task.
